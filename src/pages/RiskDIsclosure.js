            Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions
            as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but
            it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes
            exchanged for FIAT currencies around the world, but they are not
            generally backed or supported by any government or central bank.
            Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and
            demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The
            value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued
            willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for
            cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and
            total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market
            for that cryptocurrency disappear.

          Regulatory Landscape
        </b>
        <div className={styles.thisDocumentProvidesYouWit}>
          <p className={styles.thisDocumentProvides}>
            Cryptocurrencies currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in
            many jurisdictions. In addition, many cryptocurrency derivatives are
            regulated by the provisions of national and supra-national (i.e. EU)
            securities legislation; moreover, some state securities regulators
            have cautioned that many initial coin offerings are likely to fall
            within the definition of a security and subject to their respective
            securities laws. One or more jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt
            laws, regulations or directives that affect cryptocurrency networks
            and their users. Such laws, regulations or directives may impact the
            price of cryptocurrencies and their acceptance by users, merchants
            and service providers.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.thisDocumentProvides}>
            Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal,
            or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer,
            exchange, and value of cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.thisDocumentProvides}>
            Purchasing cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including
            volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation,
            and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and
            exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer
            protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign
            exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts
            a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.thisDocumentProvides}>
            Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of
            each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before
            investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use
            and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex,
            technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The
            cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security,
            integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power
            sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s
            blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency
            transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public
            ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction
            may have been initiated.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.thisDocumentProvides}>
            Cryptocurrency trading requires knowledge of cryptocurrency markets.
            In attempting to profit through cryptocurrency trading you must
            compete with traders worldwide. You should have appropriate
            knowledge and experience before engaging in substantial
            cryptocurrency trading.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.cryptocurrencyIsA}>
            Any individual cryptocurrency may change or otherwise cease to
            operate as expected due to changes made to its underlying
            technology, changes made using its underlying technology, or changes
            resulting from an attack. These changes may include, without
            limitation, a "fork," a "rollback," an "airdrop," or a "bootstrap."
            Such changes may dilute the value of an existing cryptocurrency
            position and/or distribute the value of an existing cryptocurrency
            position to another cryptocurrency.

          not controlled in any way or manner by us, and we shall not be
          responsible for any failure and/or mistake and/or error and/or breach
          which shall occur in the Binance Smart Chain blockchain ecosystem or
          in any other networks in which the ChaiT Token may be used and/or
          traded. You will be bound and subject to any change and/or amendments
          in the blockchain system and subject to any applicable law which may

          kind, express or implied, statutory or otherwise, regarding the
          blockchain functionality nor for any breach of security in the
          blockchain.

          <p className={styles.thisDocumentProvides}>
            The relatively new and rapidly evolving technology underlying
            cryptocurrencies introduces unique risks. For example, a unique
            private key is required to access, use or transfer a cryptocurrency
            on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The loss, theft or
            destruction of a private key may result in an irreversible loss of
            cryptocurrency associated with this private key. The ability to
            participate in forks could also have implications for investors. For
            example, a market participant holding a cryptocurrency position
            through a cryptocurrency exchange may be adversely impacted if the
            exchange does not allow its customers to participate in a fork that
            creates a new product.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.thisDocumentProvides}>
            The security of the ChaiDEX blockchain, and associated core
            components, is a top priority for us. Our Proof of Stake network is
            secured by the already proven Bitgert ecosystem technology and
            provides valuable services for business or private use. Our mission
            is to become a layer of trust for digital financial systems at
            internet scale, and the highest level of security is a mandatory
            prerequisite.

          <p className={styles.cryptocurrencyIsA}>
            The security researcher community regularly makes valuable
            contributions to the security of organizations and the broader
            Internet, and we recognizesthat fostering a close relationship with
            the community will help improve the security of the ChaiDEX
            platform. So, if you have information about a vulnerability in the
            ChaiDEX platform and associated components, we want to hear from

            The cybersecurity risks of cryptocurrencies and related “wallets” or
            spot exchanges include hacking vulnerabilities and a risk that
            publicly distributed ledgers may not be immutable. A cybersecurity
            event could result in a substantial, immediate and irreversible loss
            for market participants that trade cryptocurrencies. Even a minor
            cybersecurity event in a cryptocurrency is likely to result in
            downward price pressure on that product and potentially other
            cryptocurrencies.
